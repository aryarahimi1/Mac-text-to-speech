    "text": "Current Staking Status: Phase 2 Implementation\nActive Staking v2 Features\nStarkNet's current Staking v2 implementation introduces significant validator responsibilities beyond the basic staking introduced in Phase 1. Validators must now actively attest to randomly assigned blocks within each epoch, proving their continuous monitoring of network health. This attestation mechanism requires validators to submit transactions containing block hashes within specific attestation windows, ensuring they maintain operational full nodes and contribute to network security.\n\nThe current system operates with 120-block epochs (~1 hour duration) where each validator receives one block assignment per epoch. Validators must submit attestation transactions between blocks N+1 and N+16 of their assigned block N, creating accountability through publicly verifiable performance metrics. This represents a fundamental shift from passive staking to active network participation.\n\nEconomic Parameters and Rewards\nCurrent staking rewards operate at 7.71-7.72% APR based on a dynamic minting curve designed to balance participation incentives with inflation control. The minting formula M = (C/10) \u00d7 \u221aS determines annual inflation, where C=1.6% (maximum inflation cap) and S represents the staking rate. This square-root relationship ensures that higher staking participation increases total minting while decreasing individual validator rewards, creating natural market equilibrium.\n\nValidators require a 20,000 STRK minimum stake (~$4,000 at current prices) and must operate full nodes using Juno, Madara, or Pathfinder implementations. The 21-day unbonding period provides network security by preventing rapid stake withdrawals during potential attacks.\n",

    "text": "Block Production Mechanism\nEthereum's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism operates on a precisely timed schedule where validators are randomly selected to propose blocks every 12 seconds in designated time periods called slots. This deterministic timing represents a fundamental departure from the probabilistic block times of the previous proof-of-work system, providing predictable and consistent block production intervals.\n\nThe block production process involves multiple coordinated components working in sequence. Each validator must run three separate pieces of software: an execution client, a consensus client, and a validator client. The execution client handles transaction processing and maintains the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) state, while the consensus client manages the proof-of-stake protocol and validator duties. This separation of concerns, implemented during The Merge in September 2022, allows for modular development and improved system resilience.\n",
